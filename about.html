			<br />
			"For those who give us an opportunity to serve them, we provide an experience that is truly fulfilling. For our students and their parents we generate value that leaves them with a feeling of joy and contentment."

			<br>A dedicated teacher and counselor, Prof. Ganesh Kohli has done extensive research on US education and has traveled extensively across the United States. He has been invited to speak about education by various conferences and events across India and abroad. Prof. Kohli's in depth and expansive knowledge on US education has helped his students from across India, getting admission into top US universities. Some of the universities where our students have studied or are currently studying, include University of Chicago, Cornell University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Purdue University, Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Pennsylvania (Wharton), Northwestern University (Kellogg), University of Texas - Austin, Texas A & M University - College Station, Duke University and many others.

			<br>It is our firm belief that 'a counselor is to a student what a doctor is to a patient'. Like you trust a doctor with your life, you trust a counselor with your future. RJ&copy; guides students to the most suitable universities for them. RJ&copy; has assisted students with diverse profiles in their quest for quality education. This has been possible due to Prof. Ganesh Kohli's experience, an understanding of the US education system and a lot of personal attention to the student. Our students include undergraduates and graduates in engineering, architecture, medicine, pharmacy, business management, psychology, natural sciences and public administration, among others.

			<br>RJ Classes also trains students for the GRE / GMAT / CAT / CMAT / TOEFL. We have devised the most effective modules in math, verbal, and writing, which have been responsible for the outstanding results that our students have produced on these tests, including an absolute score on the GRE. This has been possible due to the small batch sizes, which ensures personalized attention to each student.

		At RJ we understand that every individual is unique. To guarantee success, the RJ program is customized for each student.<br />
		Personalized study plan: RJ Counselors design a study plan for each student based on his or her strengths and weaknesses. While no two plans are the same, the end result is the same for every student. <br />
		Personal counselor for each student: Each student is assigned an expert counselor who guides the student throughout the program and ensures that he or she is well prepared by the exam date.<br />
		Small batches to ensure individual attention: Our program is oriented towards excellent results with small batch sizes that allow faculty to give attention to every student.<br />
		Testing and Analysis: Every student appears for a number of 'Full Length Tests' at the center, and analyzes them, based on which the counselor charts the student's progress and points out corrective measures to improve his / her performance.<br /><br />
