				<h2>CAT</h2>
				<p><b>Coaching Programme for CAT</b><br/>	

The Common Admission Test (CAT) is the entrance exam for more than 160 management institutes across India, including the 13 IIMs. The written exam is conducted every year in the month of around October-Novermber over a test window of approx. 4 weeks. <br/> 
CAT focuses intensively on general aptitude (English, Math, Data Interpretation and Logical Ability) which are key areas tested in most competitive exams such as Bank PO, Campus placements. Even Civil services, GATE etc have some weightage to GA. What makes CAT special is the quality of opportunities it opens for you and therefore the nature of competition. The exam is quite rightly seen by many as the mother of all competetive exams. However, this also means that your preparation for CAT will prepare you for a good part of a llot of other exams as well. <br/> 
CAT is undoubtedly the most sought after entrance exam. However, there are several other exams besides CAT that a student can and must write. We collectively call them as OMETs (Other Management Entrance Tests). These would include XAT, SNAP, CMAT, MAT and Institute specific exams viz NMAT, TISSNET, IRMA, and IIFT. <br/>
The concepts tested in OMETs would essentially remain the same as CAT besides GK/Current affairs asked in a few tests. Your preparation for CAT will adequately prepare you for any of these exams as well. We at <b>R.J. </b>believe in thoroughness of preparation and provide adequate study material and support for each of these exams over and above CAT preparation to each student. 
Letâ€™s look at the test pattern of CAT and other national level MBA entrance tests.
